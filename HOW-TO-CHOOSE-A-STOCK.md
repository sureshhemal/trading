# How to Choose a Stock for Trading

We use the **MA50 + Breakout system** on **daily charts**. This page gives a short flow; the full rules (entry, stop loss, position size, target, checklist) are in **[SIMPLE-TRADING-GUIDE.md](./SIMPLE-TRADING-GUIDE.md)**.

Once you have a stock in mind, use the **prompts in this repo** for research, entry/exit, and risk checks.

---

## 1. Timeframe (non-negotiable)

- **Daily charts (1D) only.** One candle = one day; decisions after market close.
- Do not use 5m / 15m for this system.

---

## 2. Screen for candidates

- **Sector:** Sectors you understand or that match current themes (tech, healthcare, energy, etc.).
- **Liquidity:** Enough daily volume to enter/exit without moving the price much.
- **Volatility:** Match to your risk; higher volatility = bigger moves and risk.

---

## 3. Check the setup (MA50 + Breakout)

A stock is a valid candidate only when **all** of these are true:

- Price **above MA50**
- MA50 **sloping upward**
- Price near a **clear resistance level** (use last 1–3 months of data)
- A candle **closes above resistance**
- Breakout candle has **higher volume than recent days**

If any is missing → no trade. Patience is part of the strategy.

## 4. Write down your pick

- **Ticker** (e.g. AAPL, MSFT).
- **Reason:** e.g. "Breakout above 86, above MA50, volume confirmation."
- Keep it to one ticker and one short reason.

## 5. What to do next

- **Full system:** Read **[SIMPLE-TRADING-GUIDE.md](./SIMPLE-TRADING-GUIDE.md)** for stop loss, position size (1% risk), 2R target, and the trade checklist.
- **Prompts:** Use the prompts in this repo for research, entry/exit planning, and risk checks. Paste your ticker and context when needed.
