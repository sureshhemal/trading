# Simple Trading Guide (MA50 + Breakout System)

---

## 0) Timeframe & Decision Period (IMPORTANT)

This system is for **daily charts (1D timeframe)**.

- Each candle = 1 trading day
- Decisions are made **after market close**
- Do NOT trade on 5m / 15m charts

How long to observe:

- Identify resistance using last **1–3 months of data**
- Wait for proper breakout (can take days or weeks)
- Patience is part of strategy

---

## 1) How to Determine Entry Point

Enter ONLY when all are true:

- Price is **above MA50**
- MA50 is **sloping upward**
- Price is near a **clear resistance level**
- A candle **CLOSES above resistance**
- Breakout candle has **higher volume than recent days**

If any missing → no trade.

## 2) How to Calculate Stop Loss

Stop loss protects your money.

**Rule:**

- Find the **recent swing low**
- Place stop **slightly below it**

**Example:**

- Entry = 86  
- Swing low = 80  
- Stop loss = 79  

If price hits stop → exit without hesitation.

## 3) How to Calculate Risk Per Share

**Formula:**

Risk per share = Entry − Stop Loss

**Example:**

- Entry = 86  
- Stop = 79  
- Risk/share = 7  

---

## 4) How to Calculate Position Size

Risk only **1% of capital per trade**.

**Formula:**

Position Size = (Capital × 1%) ÷ Risk per share

**Example:**

- Capital = 100,000  
- 1% risk = 1,000  
- Risk/share = 7  

Position size:

1000 ÷ 7 = **142 shares**

---

## 5) How to Calculate Selling Price (Profit Target)

Use **2R rule** (reward = 2 × risk).

**Formula:**

Target = Entry + (2 × Risk per share)

**Example:**

- Risk/share = 7  
- Target = 86 + 14 = **100**

- [ ] Price above MA50
- [ ] MA50 trending up
- [ ] Breakout with strong volume
- [ ] Stop loss placed
- [ ] Risk ≤ 1% capital

---

- Skip bad setups
- Journal every trade

---
