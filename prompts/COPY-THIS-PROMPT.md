Analyze this stock using the MA50 + Breakout system (daily charts only).

Symbol: SYMBOL

Do the following in order:

1. **Get the setup** — Using daily (1D) data, check: Is price above MA50? Is MA50 sloping up? Is there a clear resistance (last 1–3 months)? Did a candle close above it with higher volume than recent days? If you cannot fetch live data, ask me for: current price, MA50 value, recent resistance level, and whether the last candle closed above resistance with strong volume.

2. **Entry, stop, target** — If the setup is valid: identify the entry price (e.g. breakout level), the recent swing low, and set stop slightly below it. Calculate risk per share (Entry − Stop) and profit target (Entry + 2 × risk per share).

3. **Stock check** — Answer YES/NO for the 5 entry conditions. If any is NO, say **Skip this trade** and stop. If all YES, continue.

4. **Risk check** — For position size, ask for my total capital only when needed (or use a placeholder like 100,000 and show the formula). Calculate: 1% risk amount, position size in shares (1% risk ÷ risk per share), and confirm stop loss and 2R target are set.

5. **Result** — Give me one clear verdict: **Valid trade** (with entry, stop, target, position size, and risk per share) or **Skip** (and say which condition failed).

Use the rules from HOW-TO-CHOOSE-A-STOCK and the Simple Trading Guide: daily charts, 1% risk per trade, 2R target, stop below swing low.

This runs the same workflow as **stock-check.md**, **entry-exit-plan.md**, and **risk-check.md**. In every prompt, the user's only required input is the stock symbol; you derive entry, stop, target, and other numbers from daily chart data, or ask for capital / specific values only when needed.
